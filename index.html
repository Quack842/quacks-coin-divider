                Dungeons & Dragons is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game originally designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. 
                <br> It was first published in 1974 by Tactical Studies Rules, Inc. It has been published by Wizards of the Coast since 
                1997.

        <div class="card-body">
            <p >
                In Dungeons and Dragons, there is typically a party of 4-6 players. In the game, there will be times where you/your party
                will fight a monster/creature and when the monster/creature is defeated, they drop loot (This is items that the
                monster/creature might have on them at the time). However, with a party of 4-6 players, it is difficult to split the 
                coins amongst each other. <br>
                <br>
                For Example: <br>
                Say you and your party kills 4 mosters/creatures and the total coin loot is <b>1</b> Platinum <b>5</b> Electrum 
                 <b>50</b> Gold <b>200</b> Silver and <b>300 Copper</b>. It will be difficult to calculate the amount that needs to be split
                 between the players as you can not split the Platinum into 10 gold pieces as you can not split a solid coin into pieces.
                 <br>
                 So this app will help split the total loot equally amongst each other and the remaining amount can be put in a kitty, or 
                 like how D&D work, the players can roll a die 20 for the undivided loot and the highest roll wins.
